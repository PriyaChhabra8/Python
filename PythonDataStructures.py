Lesson 2: Python Data Structures

Topic 4: Lists
Explanation:
Lists are ordered collections that can contain elements of different data types. They are mutable, meaning you can change their contents:

Indexing: Accessing elements in a list using indices.
Slicing: Extracting sublists from a list.

number = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
fruits = ['Mango','Apple','Banana','Strawberry']
#Accessing the elements
print(number[1])
#slicing
print(fruits[1:3])

#Create a list of your favorite movies and print the first and last elements.

movies = ['black swan',' Despicable me','Rachel getting married','Inception','Minions']
print(movies[0])
print(movies[-1])

#Use slicing to print the second and third elements of the list.
print(movies[2:4])
